# Moving Forward in Computer Science

## Reviewing CS 1101
### Congratulations!
+ You've met tough deadlines 
+ You've fixed challenging bugs, 
+ You've adhered to specfic style guidelines

### What have you learned?
+ The basics of programming and problem-solving
+ How to write code that not only works, but is written _well_ and is maintainable
+ The fundamentals of how computers work

### What can you do with what you've learned?
+ Learn more
  + Higher-level courses
  + Side projects and student organizations
  + Build upon the foundation you've established in CS 1101
+ Build more

    + Jamal built this after just taking CS 1101!

## Future Computer Science Courses
### General advice
+ It's supposed to be hard! 
  + Frustration is normal and should be welcomed as a motivator
  + The payoff when you actually work through a difficult bug is immensely rewarding
+ As developers, it's critical to meet specifications to the dot
  + Professionalism means delivering what the customer wants, even if it's not ideal
  + In CS1101, it can be hard to meet **all** specifications
    + These should help guide you 
    + These show what it's like to work with very explicit instructions

### Vanderbilt University CS courses

## Careers
### General Thoughts
+ Computer Science gives you many career options
+ Students often ask, "_Is CS for me?_"  
  + Do you enjoy it?
  + Do you do well on the CS 1101 assignments?
    + Tests aren't always the best indicator of your skill
+ If you pursue a career in Computer Science, I hope you find it as fulfilling as I have

### Internships
+ Pursue them, but don't become obsessed
+ Generally difficult to find until you've taken CS 2201
  + Undergraduate research is always a good option
+ Pursuing internships
  + **Apply** a lot of places
  + Take advantage of **networking** opportunities
  + **Practice** for technical interviews

### Career Paths
+ Software engineering
+ Technical consulting (and non-technical consulting!)
+ Academia
+ Pretty much anything else - employers love CS majors!
