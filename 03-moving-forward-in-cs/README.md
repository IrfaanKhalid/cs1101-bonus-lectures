# Moving Forward in Computer Science

## Reviewing CS 1101
### What have you learned?
+ The basics of programming and problem-solving
+ How to write code that not only works, but is written _well_ and maintainable
+ Fundamentals of how computers work and process tasks

### What can you do with what you've learned?
+ Keep learning; you now have an amazing foundation upon which to build your understanding of computer science
+ Build new things; you know enough to start building awesome software and to learn more to build even bigger projects
  + A great example is the RateMyProfessors Chrome plugin - this was written by a student who had just finished CS 1101
+ < unsure about this one >

## Future Computer Science Courses
### General advice
+ It's supposed to be hard! Frustration is okay, normal, and should be welcomed as a motivator
  + The payoff when you actually work through a difficult bug is immensely rewarding.
+ As developers, it's critical to meet specifications to the dot
  + Professionalism means delivering what the customer wants, even if it's not ideal
  + In CS1101, it can be hard to meet all specifications
    + They're in place to guide you and show you what it's like to work with a set of very explicit instructions
